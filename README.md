# node-passport-example

This Node application makes use of Express, Mongoose and Passport to demonstrate authentication using the `passport-local` authentication strategy.

The passport configuration settings can be found in `services/passport.js`.

Note: This does not include the `passport-local-mongoose` module. It is a custom implementation of the `passport-local` module.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start the server on localhost:3000
npm start
```
